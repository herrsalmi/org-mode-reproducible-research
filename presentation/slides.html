<li>With Org-mode, we can achieve a similar workflow, not restricted to
a particular language.</li>
<li>Using Emacs also allows to make all the steps from within Emacs. So
writing code, exectuting it, gathering outputs, making figures,
writing your paper, exporting. All of that can be done from within
one integrated and consistent environemnt,</li>

<ul>
<li>Too old?</li>
<li>Ugly?</li>
<li>Not intuitive?</li>

</ul>

<p>
Overall, GNU Emacs has a reputation of being for "experts".
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So if Emacs is so useful, why isn't it more popular among researchers?
</p>

<ul>
<li>Emacs has a long history, but is certainaly not obsolete. We saw
it comes with very modern ideas and functionalitirs.</li>
<li>It's been maintained and extended over more than 35 years which is
very long in terms of sfotware lifetime! Mostly Maintained by its own
community of users, inpedantly of any commercial purpose. This
sets aside Emacs from other editors,and I think explains why Emacs
feels and look different from other software we use day by day,
and explain some of its peculiarities.</li>

<li>Emacs encourages users to invest a bit of time in to become
confortable and make it your own.  This philosophy does match well
with the pubish or perish environement that many researchers
evolve in.</li>

<h2 id="org9962a2c">So why Emacs/Org-mode ?</h2>
<p>
<b>Beyond editing text</b>, GNU Emacs as a work environment:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Consistent</li>
<li>Efficient</li>
<li>Portable</li>
<li>Sustainable</li>

</ul>

<p>
Particularly suited for <b>open</b> and <b>reproducible</b> research.

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>It's a shame because the return on investement can be massive.</li>
<li>THis investement doenst have to cost much, setting 30min aside and
going through the tutorial can already bring a long way!</li>
<li>What you gain from Emacs is a work environment that's particularly well suited for
research.</li>

With Emacs/Org-mode, everything is text.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can read it, modify it everywhere, and anyone can.</li>
<li>Version control</li>
<li>It's great to work with, you can use a text editor</li>
<li>I likw this idea of, working on plain text, focusing on the content and strucutre,
and then, as a separate step, exporting to a richer format and focusing on the look of it.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Maintained and extended by users, since '85
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The last point I want to make is that Emacs and Org-mode are free(dom) software.
</p>
<ul>
<li>No restriction - doesn't cost anything to use. Good for people in
smaller universities, or generally in countries where research
doesn't receive has much funding.</li>
<li>Anyone can read and mdify the sourcode. Not useful for you because
it demands time and specific skills, <b>important</b> point is that other
people can and they do. Bugs are fixed, software is extended, all of
that as a community effort.</li>
<li>No company behind Emacs and Org-mode. The whole Emacs ecosystem is a
communtiy effort, that's not driven by any private interest.</li>
<li>I want to conclude this talk by saying that this specific apsect of
Emacs makes it particularly suited from academic research.</li>
