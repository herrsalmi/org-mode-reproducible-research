  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - Scientific research is made of a wide range of activities (data collection, data processing, making figures, writing papers)
  - Difficult to keep track of data, software, figures from one step to another.
  - Instead we want to work in an environment that makes keeping
    things consistent easy, almost like we don't have to think about
    it.
  #+END_NOTES

* Facilitating research reproducibility
  
  - Clear relationship between data, code and analysis.
  - Portable and sustainable tools and formats.

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - When we look at data, we wanna see what generated it.
    - When we look at a figure, we wanna see what generated it, and from which data
    - When we change the data, we don't want to have to manually do the analysis again, that's when errors occur.
    - We want the software we use to be usable by anyone, especially across OSs and versions of them.
    - We also want to use tools and formats that will be usable in the future.

* Example workflow

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - Workflows for reproducible science topically look like this.
  - Clear pathway between data and paper. Plain text.
  - Complicated, many different moving part. Specific to R.

* GNU Emacs and Org-mode

Or how to bundle software, data and analysis in a single plain text file.
#+end_center

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- With Org-mode, we can achieve a similar workflow, not restricted to
  a particular language.
- Using Emacs also allows to make all the steps from within Emacs. So
  writing code, exectuting it, gathering outputs, making figures,
  writing your paper, exporting. All of that can be done from within
  one integrated and consistent environemnt,
- Let's see what it looks like.
#+END_NOTES

* Emacs: used by many, but not widely
  - Too old?
  - Ugly?
  - Not intuitive?

  Overall, GNU Emacs has a reputation of being for "experts".
  
  #+begin_notes
  So if Emacs is so useful, why isn't it more popular among researchers?
  
  - Emacs has a long history, but is certainaly not obsolete. We saw
    it comes with very modern ideas and functionalitirs.
  - It's been maintained and extended over more than 35 years which is
    very long in terms of sfotware lifetime! Mostly Maintained by its own
    community of users, inpedantly of any commercial purpose. This
    sets aside Emacs from other editors,and I think explains why Emacs
    feels and look different from other software we use day by day,
    and explain some of its peculiarities.
  
  - Emacs encourages users to invest a bit of time in to become
    confortable and make it your own.  This philosophy does match well
    with the pubish or perish environement that many researchers
    evolve in.
  #+end_notes

* So why Emacs/Org-mode ?
  
  *Beyond editing text*, GNU Emacs as a work environment:

  - Consistent
  - Efficient
  - Portable
  - Sustainable

  Particularly suited for *open* and *reproducible* research.

  #+begin_notes
  - It's a shame because the return on investement can be massive.
  - THis investement doenst have to cost much, setting 30min aside and
    going through the tutorial can already bring a long way!
  - What you gain from Emacs is a work environment that's particularly well suited for
    research.
  #+end_notes

* Your research in plain text!

The most portable and future-proof format.

#+begin_notes
With Emacs/Org-mode, everything is text.
- You can read it, modify it everywhere, and anyone can.
- Version control
- It's great to work with, you can use a text editor
- I likw this idea of, working on plain text, focusing on the content and strucutre,
  and then, as a separate step, exporting to a richer format and focusing on the look of it.

* Wherever you go, you will find GNU Emacs...

#+end_center

#+begin_notes
- Org-mode comes within GNU Emacs, and you can find it anywhere
- Don't even need a graphical interface. If you're working on a remote
  server through ssh for instance, you can still use Emacs.
#+end_notes

* GNU Emacs and Org-mode are free/libre software

  - No restriction on use
  - Anyone can read/modify the source code
  - Anyone can redistribute ("fork") it

  Maintained and extended by users, since '85

#+begin_notes
The last point I want to make is that Emacs and Org-mode are free(dom) software.
- No restriction - doesn't cost anything to use. Good for people in
  smaller universities, or generally in countries where research
  doesn't receive has much funding.
- Anyone can read and mdify the sourcode. Not useful for you because
  it demands time and specific skills, *important* point is that other
  people can and they do. Bugs are fixed, software is extended, all of
  that as a community effort.
- No company behind Emacs and Org-mode. The whole Emacs ecosystem is a
  communtiy effort, that's not driven by any private interest.
- I want to conclude this talk by saying that this specific apsect of
  Emacs makes it particularly suited from academic research.

  That's it for me, I hope you found the talk interesting and that it
  gave you food for thoughts, and please feel free to ask me any questions now!
