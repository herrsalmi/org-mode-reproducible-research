* What is Org-mode

Org-mode is a /major mode/ of GNU Emacs.

It displays text files in a way that helps structuring documents,
according to a *simple syntax*.

Writing Org files is a bit like writing with light markup languages
such as:

- Markdown
  - A sublist
- AsciiDoc
- RestructuredText
- ...

Org has a [[https://orgmode.org][brand new website]].

* Org is great to work with
* A subheader

- HTML
- ODT

A lot of third party exporters developped by the community:

- Markdown
- Hugo website
